## Hello, I'm Olena

I’m a Computer Vision Engineer with 3 years of professional experience primarly working at Samusng R&D Institute. I have successfully designed and implemented deep learning solutions for complex computer vision challenges, including **depth estimation**, **3D object tracking**, **segmentation**, **room layout estimation** as well as worked with **human pose estimation** and other computer vision problems.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Deploying deep learning model on mobile device
**Description**: This project trains and evaluates a deep learning classification model, then converts and quantizes it using ONNX for mobile deployment. An Android Studio app integrates the quantized model, enabling real-time video and gallery-based image classification.  
**Tech Stack**: Python, PyTorch, ONNX, Kotlin  
[Check it out here](https://github.com/Ramina16/Quantization)

### 2. 3D Reconstruction
**Description**: This project contains code that leverages depth maps and COLMAP to perform 3D scene reconstruction.  
**Tech Stack**: Python, COLMAP  
[Check it out here](https://github.com/Ramina16/3D_reconstruction)

### 3. Stereo images rectification
**Description**: This project focuses on stereo images rectification for two cases: with unknown and known camera intrinsics parameters.  
**Tech Stack**: Python
